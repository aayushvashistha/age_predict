# age_predict

This code will predict the age through main camera. 

Currently, I am using small trained data to predict the age. In future, I intend to train better data input and try to predict the age more accurately.

This code is developed by using data from kaggle, out of which model is created. The accuracy of this modal is currenly 60% and I am thinking to re-train the model by taking more new datasets.
